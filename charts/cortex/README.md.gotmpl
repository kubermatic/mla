## Dependencies

### Key-Value store

Cortex requires an externally provided key-value store, such as [etcd](https://etcd.io/) or [Consul](https://www.consul.io/).

Both services can be installed alongside Cortex, for example using helm charts available [here](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/etcd) and [here](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/consul).

### Storage

Cortex requires a storage backend to store metrics and indexes.
See [cortex documentation](https://cortexmetrics.io/docs/) for details on storage types and documentation

## Installation

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.
Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.

Once Helm is set up properly, add the repo as follows:

```bash
  helm repo add cortex-helm https://cortexproject.github.io/cortex-helm-chart
```

Cortex can now be installed with the following command:

```bash
  helm install cortex --namespace cortex cortex-helm/cortex
```

If you have custom options or values you want to override:

```bash
  helm install cortex --namespace cortex -f my-cortex-values.yaml cortex-helm/cortex
```

Specific versions of the chart can be installed using the `--version` option, with the default being the latest release.
What versions are available for installation can be listed with the following command:

```bash
  helm search repo cortex-helm
```

As part of this chart many different pods and services are installed which all
have varying resource requirements. Please make sure that you have sufficient
resources (CPU/memory) available in your cluster before installing Cortex Helm
chart.


## Upgrades

To upgrade Cortex use the following command:

```bash
  helm upgrade cortex -f my-cortex-values.yaml cortex-helm/cortex
```
